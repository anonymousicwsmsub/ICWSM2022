## tweet_ids.csv
This file contains 200 randomly picked tweet ids from our larger dataset which will be released upon acceptance of this paper. These Tweet IDs directly form a 1-1 mapping to a tweet on the twitter website. To access the tweet, one must hydrate the tweet using the twitter API. The GET /tweets endpoint is a way to hydrate a set of Tweets IDs that you pass through with your request, allowing you to see all of the metadata associated with those Tweets. This link https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/tweets-and-users/quick-start/get-tweets will help you get started.
